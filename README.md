## Intruduction

Hello and welcome to my new fron-end project of a news app.

The app is available online under this link:

https://main--marekfeproapp.netlify.app/

This project is a simplified social-media type of service with a user-generated feed, that allows adding comments and votes to a given article (topic). Think of it as a very basic version of... early reddit perhaps?

It is coded in React, HTML and CSS and it uses a back-end app, that I created beforehand and which you can find under this link:
https://github.com/MarekJanu/nc_news_be_project

My aim was to make it in fully responsive design and to utilize features offered by back-end it is connected to.

Overall, this project (front and back) reflects 13 weeks of developing and learning coding skills during the Northcoders bootcamp.

Please feel free to fork and clone this repo.

If you would like to run it locally - fork it and clone it. You will need to install npm (npm install - at least version 19).
After that simply type npm start.

Feel free to explore my app under the live link and please leave a commetn if you like it.

Thank you for visiting!
